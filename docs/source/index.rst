Welcome to CMD Somatic Panel Pipeline documentation!
===================================

**CMD Somatic Panel Pipeline** is a nextflow based clinical bioinformatics pipeline.The pipeline takes raw sequencing files as *fastq.gz* provided as *samplesheet.csv* along with other meta data such as sample type, sex, number of reads. The pipeline is intended to run in CMD high performance clusters (grace or hopper) along with all the references files in the config file. The results produced by the pipelines are visualized and reported in in-house interpretation and visualization tools.
